# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a program that holds all it needs to run inside itself.  It is often times reusable which makes it a very valuable tool to create when needing to run the same type of algorithm multiple times.

  Researched answer:  A function is a section of code created to be ran when it is called on and only when called on, otherwise it remains idle.  For example a function will be called when console.log(function(input)).



2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer:
  .map takes an array and manipulates the data and places new data into a new array (You can multiply entire array by 5 and have a new array that reflects the results).  
  .filter makes a sub-array and removes certain factors of the original array.
  (You are in a sense using an if/else statement to remove certain components from array and placing results in a new array)

  Researched answer:
  .map returns an array the same length as the original and performs a type of action to it.
  .filter returns a subset of the array that has been filtered with a built in if/else statement.



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log is used to show in terminal what the result of program is.  Return is used inside a function to show result of a section of code but does not print to the terminal until completed function and is console.log'ed

  Researched answer:
console.log "prints" the answer in the terminal to show code results while return only returns result within a function, not showing result in terminal, but being allowed to be used in a console.log to show result.


4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer:  An argument is the information that will be ran through the function provided by user.  This will often be a variable that is provided with an array or string.

  Researched answer:
An argument is a value that is passed through a function, used as a local variable which can be used within the function to create a new result.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:  Pair programming usually has two distinct roles, the driver and the navigator.  The driver is typing the code and running it while the navigator is directing the driver on what code should be used and the approach to the problem.  It is best practice to switch roles frequently and to communicate often and clearly on the direction being taken.

  Researched answer:  
Communication is key in pair programming.  Establishing roles early on and switching frequently to give breaks to each other from mentally taxing tasks is extremely beneficial.  The roles are often divided into driver and navigator.  The driver has their hands on the keys and are typing out the code while the navigator is walking the driver through the steps of what code to type.  The navigator often times is problem solving through the equation and communicating clearly any pseudo code and specific steps they wish to execute.


6. What is iteration?

  Your answer:  An iteration is a cycle of a loop.  Each time a loop is repeated is an iteration.

  Researched answer:  An iteration is a repeated action on a loop.  Each time an item is repeated inside a for loop, the action is called an iteration.



7. What are advantages and disadvantages for using terminal commands to interact with your computer?

  Your answer:  The advantages are you are directly communicating to the brain of your computer so there are no weird quirks that gui's can occasionally have.  The disadvantages are that it can get a little confusing, especially if you are in a different directory then intended, and the terminal is not as user "friendly" and "pretty" as a gui.

  Researched answer:
Advantages:  Using terminal commands use less memory and can be much faster of you know how to use it properly.  You can also rerun commands quickly which is very handy for checking and debugging code.
Disadvantages: You can cause serious damage to your computer by typing the wrong commands, and commands can be very long depending on the size of file.  Can be confusing at first, especially when learning how to interface with github.

8. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:  Each time we used pair programming, it really helped engrain the topic and materials into my head.  I also LOVED the peanut butter and jelly sandwich activity, because it had a great message that a computer can only do EXACTLY step by step what it is told...plus it was funny!



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- Jest - Jest is a popular test runner for javascript

- Test Driven Development - a process that creates test cases and requirements prior to creating software so the software is developed to the parameters set.

- Classes - This depends on the area you are discussing.  From my research, often times it refers to a set that is defined by a keyword.

- React - A javascript library that is used to create a build interactive user interfaces.

- React State - This is a built in method that stores a value and allows the value to be changed later on.  

- CRUD - Create, read, update and delete is the acronym for the process of performing persistent storage applications.
